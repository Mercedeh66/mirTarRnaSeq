\title{twoTimePointSamp miRNA and mRNA interrelation in two timepoints sampling}
\usage{
twoTimePointSamp(mRNA, miRNA, Shrounds = 100, Srounds = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{mRNA}{mRNA file generated from foldchanges (FC) obj of the one2OneRnaMiRNA.}

\item{miRNA}{miRNA file generated from foldchanges (FC) obj of the one2OneRnaMiRNA.}

\item{Shrounds}{number of shufflings over the FC data, default is 100.}

\item{Srounds}{number of sampling from the shuffled data, default is 1000.}
}
\value{
miRNA mRNA interelation dataframe
}
\description{
This function uses the output of one2OneRnaMiRNA and retruns a sampled from orig file
interrelation dataframe depending on user sampling selection.
